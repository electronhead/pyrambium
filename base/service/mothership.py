"""
This class implements a single process-based system for defining and scheduling actions local
to the python runtime (api server, testing harness). The class implements all of the potential
endpoints of a restful api and supports testing outside of the restful api implementation.

Instances of this class contain Schedulers and Actions, which can at any point be submitted to and removed from the
job scheduling mechanism of the schedule library (refer to the 'continuous' module).
